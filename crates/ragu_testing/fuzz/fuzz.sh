# Run all fuzz targets. Defaults to 30 seconds each, sequential.
#
# Usage:
#   ./fuzz.sh              # 30s each, sequential
#   ./fuzz.sh 60           # 1 min each, sequential
#   ./fuzz.sh 300 -j       # 5 min each, parallel
#   DICT=1 ./fuzz.sh       # Load dict.txt of Ragu field-element constants
#
# The DICT=1 path passes -dict=dict.txt to libFuzzer. Empirical comparison
# (60s on fuzz_element_ops): roughly flat coverage with a small features
# decrease; on fuzz_poseidon_sponge: small features and corpus increase.
# Worth trying for Poseidon-heavy targets in longer runs.
#
# Regenerate dict.txt via:
#   cargo +nightly run --release --bin extract_dict > dict.txt
