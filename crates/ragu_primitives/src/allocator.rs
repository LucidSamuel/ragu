//! Allocator abstraction for gadgets.
//!
//! [`Allocator`] decouples the decision of *how* to allocate a wire from the
//! driver currently running synthesis. Gadget code asks an allocator to
//! allocate, and the allocator decides whether to pack this allocation into
//! a shared gate or allocate a fresh one.
//!
//! This module ships two implementations:
//!
//! - [`Allocator`] for `()` — a stateless allocator that allocates a
//!   multiplication gate with zeroed $a$ and $c$ wires via
//!   [`Driver::mul`], returning the $b$ wire. Simple but wasteful: each
//!   allocation consumes a full gate.
//!
//! - [`SimpleAllocator`] — pairs consecutive allocations into one gate,
//!   stashing the `Extra` token from the first allocation for use by the
//!   second. This halves the number of gates consumed by pure allocations.

/// allocates a full multiplication gate with zeroed $a$ and $c$ wires.
/// [`SimpleAllocator`] pairs two consecutive allocations into a
/// single gate by stashing the [`Extra`](ragu_core::drivers::DriverTypes::Extra)

/// Allocator that pairs consecutive allocations into a single gate.
///
/// Each gate allocates four wires $(A, B, C, D)$ with the constraints
/// $A \cdot B = C$ and $C \cdot D = 0$. When $A$ and $C$ are both zero the
/// gate is unconstrained over $B$ and $D$, so two independent values can be
/// packed into one gate. `SimpleAllocator` exploits this: the first call
/// allocates a gate with $A = C = 0$, returns the $B$ wire, and stashes the
/// [`Extra`](ragu_core::drivers::DriverTypes::Extra) token for the $D$ wire.
/// The second call redeems that token via
/// [`assign_extra`](ragu_core::drivers::DriverTypes::assign_extra),
/// returning $D$ without allocating a new gate.
///
/// This is the standard paired-allocation strategy. Gadgets that perform
/// many allocations should use `SimpleAllocator` to halve gate cost.
///
/// Dropping a `SimpleAllocator` that still holds a stashed token leaves
/// that gate's $D$ wire assigned to zero, which is always safe: the gate
/// has $C = 0$, so $C \cdot D = 0$ holds regardless.
