//! Patcher regression tests for the production internal recursion circuits.
//!
//! [`capture_internal_circuits`] hands every native and nested internal circuit its
//! [`CircuitSpec`] and its honest witness, which exist only mid-fuse, to a
//! visitor. Here the visitor captures each circuit through the recording
//! driver and checks:
//!
//! * `constraints_hold` — the [reserved-wire overlay](ragu_testing::patcher::overlay_reserved)
//!   recovered the honest stage-wire values that `configure_stage` zeros (and
//!   the virtual wires computed from them), so the honest witness satisfies
//!   the recorded graph. This exercises the whole engine on the production
//!   circuits at once: routines (Poseidon permutations), pooled allocation,
//!   and multi-stage reservation.
//! * `playback` — a second, independent synthesis re-accepts the same
//!   witness, so the recording matches a live re-execution rather than merely
//!   agreeing with itself.
//! * `forced_by`, in two tiers — granting the declared inputs plus every other
//!   free wire except the declared outputs, the bounded solver must derive
//!   every output; one it cannot reach is an output the circuit never
//!   constrains, which no cheat sweep would tell, so it fails here, before
//!   fuzzing. And the inputs *alone* must force every output: the solver's
//!   case analysis on booleans is what carries it through `compute_v`'s
//!   endoscalar decomposition.
//! * a wrong spec is refused — declaring a received commitment coordinate of
//!   `hashes_1` as an output fails that check, so it is not vacuous on graphs
//!   this size.
//! * [`Prepared`] agrees with the full probe — the incremental probe the fuzz
//!   target runs returns the full [`determinism_probe`]'s verdict (or a more
//!   conclusive one) on a spread of single-wire cheats, none of which is a
//!   signal; their timings are printed for the record.
//! * a full single-wire sweep — every cheatable wire of every circuit is
//!   nudged through the prepared probe: no violation, and enough probes
//!   accepted that the sweep is not vacuous.
//!
//! The circuits are captured at three points of a small tree: the bootstrap
//! base case (over two synthesized dummy children, where `outer_collapse`
//! leaves `c` free by design), a fuse of two leaves, and a fuse of two such
//! nodes. The
//! census — wire counts, declarations, cheatable wires, sweep tallies — is
//! pinned per circuit and point, so a change that adds or removes hints,
//! stage wires or instance wires is noticed here.
//! Capture and playback use one sequential proof tree. The static checks and
//! complete sweeps run in parallel over its recorded circuits at each point.
//!
//! Run by the PR fuzz harness job with
//! `cargo test --release --lib internal_patcher::tests -- --include-ignored`.
