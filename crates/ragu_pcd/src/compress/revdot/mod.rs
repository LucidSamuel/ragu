//! Reduction 1: from revdot claims to polynomial openings.
//!
//! The [`fold`] first collapses the claims on one curve to three, $(A, B)$
//! and one $(E, W)$ per layer, committing each layer's error terms before
//! its challenges. The split then takes those three as $t(X) = \sum_i
//! \rho^i a_i(X) b_i(X)$, splits it as $t(X) = X^{n-1} p(1/X) + X^n q(X)$,
//! so that $p(0) = \sum_i \rho^i \operatorname{revdot}(a_i, b_i)$, and
//! commits to $p$ and $q$. The verifier squeezes $r$ and checks $\sum_i
//! \rho^i a_i(r) b_i(r) = r^{n-1} p(1/r) + r^n q(r)$ from the claimed
//! openings, then hands every opening it relied on to the batch: each
//! [`Derived`] polynomial at its point, $p$ at $1/r$ and at $0$, where it
//! must equal $\sum_i \rho^i k_i$, and $q$ at $r$.
//!
//! Both sides take the claims in the decider's order, the prover through
//! [`claims::Builder`](crate::internal::claims::Builder) and the verifier
//! through the [`claims`]' shapes.
//!
//! The transcript is assumed to have seen the commitments the claims are
//! over, and $y$ and $z$ to have been squeezed from it.
