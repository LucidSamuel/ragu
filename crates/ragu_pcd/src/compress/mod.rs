//! Proof compression: the decider's checks restated over commitments and
//! openings, ending in one IPA opening per curve.
//!
//! Built up in stages. The [`claims`] module evaluates the revdot claims
//! from openings, [`revdot`] reduces them to polynomial openings, and
//! [`batch`] combines every opening into the one claim the IPA proves, and
//! [`instance`] carries what the verifier reads besides polynomials and
//! restates the decider's remaining checks over it; the compressed proof
//! itself follows.

// Consumed by the compressed prover and verifier once they land.
