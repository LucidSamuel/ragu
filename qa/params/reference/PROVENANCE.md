# Sage reference output

Verbatim stdout of the reference parameter generator at ragu's parameters. This
is the authority the pure-Python port in `../poseidon_params.py` is measured
against, and the tables in `udon` (the Udon repository's `crates/udon/src/poseidon/pallas_{base,scalar}.rs`) are
compared to it directly.

For both fields the MDS matrix here equals the first Cauchy candidate the
Grain stream yields (the port emits exactly that, and agrees), so the script's
security filter accepted the first candidate and the port's lack of that filter
costs nothing at these parameters. The `Result Algorithm` lines in the output
do not show this on their own: the script re-runs the filter on the matrix it
returns, so they read `True` regardless of how many candidates it rejected.

To reproduce, clone the fork at that revision and run the invocations above.
Nothing in CI needs Sage; these files are the checked-in result.
