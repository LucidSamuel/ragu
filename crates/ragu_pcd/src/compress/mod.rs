//! Proof compression: the decider's checks restated over commitments and

//!
//! Built up in stages. The [`claims`] module evaluates the revdot claims

//! [`batch`] combines every opening into the one claim the IPA proves; the
//! compressed proof itself follows.

// Consumed by the compressed prover and verifier once they land.
