//! Running the engine against a [`Circuit`] through its public API.
//!
//! [`capture`] synthesizes a circuit's witness through the [`Recorder`] and
//! then serializes its public output, exactly as trace evaluation does — so
//! the result carries the constraint graph, the honest wire values, *and*
//! the wires of the public instance in $k(Y)$ order. [`playback`] re-runs the
//! same synthesis through [`Playback`] over an injected witness.
//!
//! Nothing about the circuit is assumed beyond the trait: it builds its own
//! allocators (the recorder's `Extra = usize` supports the pooling
//! [`Standard`](ragu_primitives::allocator::Standard) allocator circuits
//! normally use), may call routines, and may emit constraints while writing
//! its output.
//!
//! # Staged circuits
//!
//! A [`MultiStage`](ragu_circuits::staging::MultiStage)-wrapped circuit —
//! every internal recursion circuit is one — reserves its stage wires
//! through `configure_stage`, which allocates them holding `Coeff::Zero` in
//! the consuming driver; the real stage values live in the separately
//! committed stage polynomials `r(X) = trace + Σ rx`. So the raw recording
//! of such a circuit is *internally inconsistent*: a post-stage gadget
//! computed a gate from a stage output's honest value but copy-constrained
//! that gate to the stage wire, which reads zero. [`capture_with_stage_values`]
//! takes the honest stage values from the caller — who has the stage
//! witnesses — writes them onto the reserved prefix and recomputes the
//! virtual wires, so its result satisfies
//! [`constraints_hold`](super::constraints_hold) like any other, and names
//! every reserved wire in [`Capture::stage_wires`] so an oracle can declare
//! each one. [`capture`] is the entry point for a plain circuit; on a staged
//! one it fails closed.
