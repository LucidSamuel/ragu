//! Unblinded inner product argument (IPA) for polynomial commitments.
//!
//! Adapted from halo2's `halo2_proofs/src/poly/commitment`. Pedersen blinding
//! with generator `W` is omitted for now because compression currently proves
//! unblinded relations. An opening proves knowledge of `p` with
//! `P = <p, G>` and `p(x) = v`.
//!
//! The masking polynomial `s`, with `s(x) = 0`, is retained to mask the
//! coefficients folded by the argument. Fiat-Shamir goes through
//! [`IpaTranscript`], implemented for both curves by [`CycleTranscript`].
