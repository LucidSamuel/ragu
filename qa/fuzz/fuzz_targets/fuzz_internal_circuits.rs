//! The patcher's soundness oracle aimed at the **production internal
//! recursion circuits**.
//!
//! Every other patcher target hunts under-constrained advice in *generated*
//! substrate programs. This one hunts it in the circuits that actually carry
//! ragu's recursion — the native `hashes_1`, `hashes_2`, `inner_collapse`,
//! `outer_collapse` and `compute_v`, and the nested endoscaling steps — by
//! capturing them from real fuses and then playing a malicious prover
//! against the constraints they emitted.
//!
//! # Setup, paid once
//!
//! The circuits' honest witnesses exist only mid-fuse, so
//! [`capture_internal_circuits`] runs real fuses and hands each
//! circuit, its [`CircuitSpec`] and its witness to a visitor that records the
//! constraint graph ([`ragu_testing::patcher::capture_with_stage_values`]). It
//! does so at four [`Point`]s of a tree, because the cheap ones are degenerate
//! in their own ways — the bootstrap base case consumes synthesized dummies
//! and leaves `outer_collapse`'s `c` free, while two children of equal depth
//! make the two sides of a collapse mirror images — and no single point is
//! representative.
//!
//! The points differ in more than shape. Each builds from its own RNG seed and,
//! when applicable, its own leaf witnesses, so the four captures are not four
//! views of the same field elements. And the base case runs in an application
//! registering one step rather than two or three. That puts the registry at
//! $2^4$ circuits instead of $2^5$ — a different width for `compute_v` to
//! evaluate over, not just a different tree.
//!
//! That costs some tens of seconds and happens once, in libFuzzer's `init`;
//! every fuzz iteration afterwards works on the captured graphs through a
//! [`Prepared`] probe, which solved the part of each witness the inputs force
//! once and only re-solves what a cheat can still change.
//! Each captured honest witness is replayed through fresh synthesis during
//! initialization, using the same checks as the PR regression suite.
//!
//! # The oracle
//!
//! A circuit's spec declares what it is responsible for: the unified instance
//! slots it covers and the stage values it checks (see
//! [`ragu_pcd::fuzzing::patcher`]). Those are its **outputs**; every other instance
//! wire and every other reserved stage wire is an **input** — received
//! commitments, challenges another circuit derived, stage values another
//! circuit checks. Before any fuzzing, witness-free
//! [`analyze_source_shape`](ragu_testing_fuzz::source_shape::analyze_source_shape) must
//! match concrete synthesis exactly; connectivity analysis rejects isolated wires and
//! floating subgraphs; bounded component-local Jacobian checks reject movable
//! derived wires and require non-vacuous rank coverage; and
//! [`forced_by`](ragu_testing::patcher::forced_by) runs twice. Granting the
//! inputs and every other free wire except the outputs, it must derive every
//! output — one it cannot reach is an output the circuit never constrains, a
//! finding in itself, and the harness refuses to start; it also reports how
//! many outputs the inputs *alone* force. Components too large for dense rank
//! elimination are explicitly reported as skipped by the analysis API rather
//! than certified.
//!
//! Then: pin the inputs, let the prover rewrite any other free advice —
//! Poseidon hints, allocator slack, the outputs themselves — and repair the
//! rest of the witness through the captured constraints. If every constraint
//! still holds while an **output** moved, the circuit accepts two witnesses
//! that agree on everything it received and disagree on something it is
//! responsible for. For the hash circuits that is a Fiat–Shamir binding
//! break; for the collapse circuits, a folded claim the prover can choose;
//! for an endoscaling step, an accumulator the prover can steer. Either way
//! it is a soundness bug, and the accepting witness is the evidence.
//!
//! A repaired witness the constraints *reject* is inconclusive — the solver
//! is deliberately bounded — and is never a signal.
//!
//! # The accepting witness is replayed before it is believed
//!
//! Everything above is judged against the *recorded* graph. A capture that
//! drifted from what ragu really synthesizes would produce a verdict about a
//! circuit that does not exist, and the recording path — a stage overlay, a
//! recorder allocation order — is exactly the sort of thing that drifts as the
//! production code moves. So a signal is not reported on the strength of the
//! recording alone. The accepting witness is injected back into a **fresh
//! synthesis of the same circuit** through
//! [`playback`](ragu_testing::patcher::playback), which re-runs the real
//! gadget code and checks every gate, `C · D = 0`, linear definition and
//! `enforce_zero` against the injected values — and that the synthesis
//! consumed exactly the wires the witness names. Only a witness fresh
//! synthesis also accepts is called soundness evidence.
//!
//! A witness the replay *rejects* is a finding of a different kind — the
//! capture and the circuit disagree, so every verdict this target has produced
//! about that circuit is unsound in both directions — and is reported as such
//! rather than quietly dropped. Replaying rebuilds the capture point from its
//! seed and costs seconds, which is why it happens only once a probe has
//! already fired.
//!
//! What the replay does *not* cover: `capture_internal_circuits_at` reproduces
//! `fuse`'s witness generation by mirroring it — the same challenges squeezed
//! from the same transcript in the same order — and the replay re-runs that
//! same path, so a mirror that has drifted from `fuse` is reproduced faithfully
//! rather than caught. The structural half of that drift (a circuit added to
//! the recursion and forgotten here, or one whose wire counts moved) is pinned
//! by the census in `qa/fuzz/src/internal_patcher_regression.rs`. Value-level drift —
//! the mirror deriving a *different* honest witness than a real fuse would —
//! is not checked anywhere yet, and wants the two paths sharing one
//! implementation rather than another test.
