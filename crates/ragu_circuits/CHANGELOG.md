## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added iteration over the stored coefficients of sparse polynomials.
- Added `Tag::from_beacon` and `RegistryBuilder::with_tag` for caller-supplied
  tags chosen after the circuits are fixed. Finalization requires a tag;
  `insecure-test-registry-tag` enables a fixed fallback for tests only.

### Changed

- Temporarily replaced evaluation-based registry tags with caller-supplied tags.

- Renamed `registry::Key` to `registry::Tag` and `Registry::digest()` to
  `Registry::tag()`.
