//! Stage wire indices and their locations in rx polynomials.
//!
//! A stage's rx polynomial carries its values unblinded:
//! [`StageExt::rx`](super::StageExt::rx) puts the blinding `alpha` at the
//! SYSTEM gate alone and the values, two per gate, at the $a$ and $d$
//! wires of the stage's reserved gates in allocation order. A value can be
//! named by its reservation index (the order the stage's output gadget
//! traverses its wires) and read straight off the polynomial at the degree
//! that index maps to. These helpers let consumers identify stage fields and
//! read their values using the same layout as stage construction and loading.
