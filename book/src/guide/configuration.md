# Configuration

When building a PCD application with Ragu, you configure three key parameters
that determine the system's capacity and behavior.

## Application Parameters

The `ApplicationBuilder` requires three type parameters:

```rust
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, 4>::new()
//                  ^^^^^  ^^^^   ^
//                  Cycle  Rank   Header Size
```

Let's understand each one.

## 1. Cycle: Pasta

The **Cycle** parameter specifies the elliptic curve cycle used for recursive
proof composition.

```rust
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, ...>::new()
//                  ^^^^^ curve cycle
```

### What is Pasta?

Pasta is a 2-cycle of elliptic curves (Pallas and Vesta) specifically
designed for efficient recursion:
- **Pallas**: base field (`Fp`) used in the circuit layer
- **Vesta**: base field (`Fq`) used in the proof layer

These curves have matching field/group orders, enabling efficient proof
recursion without expensive non-native field arithmetic.

### Setup

Load the Pasta parameters:

```rust
use ragu_pasta::Pasta;

let pasta = Pasta::baked();  // Requires the `baked` crate feature
```

Without the `baked` feature, use [`Pasta::generate()`] to compute parameters
at runtime instead.

The `baked()` method returns precomputed generator points for Pallas and
Vesta, loaded from data embedded in the binary. Poseidon parameters are
compile-time constants and do not require initialization.

### Why Pasta?

- **Efficient recursion**: Designed specifically for recursive proof systems
- **No trusted setup**: Transparent parameters
- **Battle-tested**: Used in production by Zcash
- **Standard**: Compatible with Halo 2 and other Pasta-based systems

## 2. Rank: `R<N>`

The **Rank** parameter controls circuit capacity - how many constraints each
circuit can handle.

```rust
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, ...>::new()
//                           ^^^^ rank = 2^13
```

### Understanding Rank

`R<N>` sets the polynomial size to 2^N coefficients, which determines two
constraint limits:

- **Gates**: up to 2^(N−2)
- **Constraints**: up to 2^N

Currently only `R<7>` (testing) and `R<13>` (production) are implemented.
See the `Rank` trait documentation for how to add new values.

| Rank | Gate Limit | Constraint Limit | Use Case |
|------|---------------------|-------------|----------|
| `R<7>` | 32 | 128 | Unit tests |
| `R<13>` | 2,048 | 8,192 | Production |

### Choosing the Right Rank

**For testing**: Use `R<7>`
- Fast proving, quick iteration
- Suitable for small test circuits

**For production**: Use `R<13>`
- 2,048 gates, 8,192 constraints
- Standard capacity for most applications

### What Happens if You Exceed Rank?

```rust
Error: exceeded the maximum number of gates (2048)
```

**Solutions**:
1. Add a larger rank (see the `Rank` trait documentation) and switch to it
2. Optimize circuit: Reduce unnecessary operations
3. Split into multiple steps: Break large computation into smaller pieces

[Step Capacity and Proving Cost](capacity.md) measures what each of these costs,
including how much a step holds and what splitting one is worth.

## 3. HEADER_SIZE

The **HEADER_SIZE** parameter specifies how many field elements flow through
each proof's header.

```rust
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, 4>::new()
//                                  ^ header size
```

### What are Headers?

Headers are the data that flows through your proof tree. Each proof carries:
- **Left child's header** (HEADER_SIZE elements)
- **Right child's header** (HEADER_SIZE elements)
- **Own output header** (HEADER_SIZE elements)

### Sizing Your Headers

The size depends on what data you need to track:

**Simple hash (1 element)**:
```rust
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, 1>::new()

struct MyHeader;
impl Header<F> for MyHeader {
    type Output = Kind![F; Element<'_, _>];  // Single field element
}
```

**Merkle root + metadata (4 elements)**:
```rust
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, 4>::new()

struct MyHeader;
impl Header<F> for MyHeader {
    type Output = Kind![F; (
        Element<'_, _>,  // Merkle root
        Element<'_, _>,  // Block height
        Element<'_, _>,  // Timestamp
        Element<'_, _>,  // State hash
    )];
}
```

**Complex state (8+ elements)**:
```rust
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, 8>::new()

// Multiple values, counters, flags, etc.
```

### Header Size Trade-offs

**Smaller headers (1-2 elements)**:
- ✓ Faster proving
- ✓ Less memory usage
- ✗ Limited data per proof

**Larger headers (4-8 elements)**:
- ✓ More data per proof
- ✓ Rich application state
- ✗ Slower proving
- ✗ More memory

**Rule of thumb**: Use the minimum size that fits your data. Don't
over-allocate.

### Changing Header Size

If you need to change HEADER_SIZE:

1. Update `ApplicationBuilder` parameter
2. Update all `Header::Output` types to match
3. Rebuild application:
   ```rust
   let app = ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, NEW_SIZE>::new()
   ```

The type system will catch mismatches at compile time.

## Complete Configuration Example

Here's a production-ready configuration:

```rust
use ragu_circuits::polynomials::R;
use ragu_pasta::Pasta;
use ragu_pcd::{ApplicationBuilder, RegistryTags};

// Initialize Pasta curves
let pasta = Pasta::baked();

// The output of a public randomness beacon, drawn after the code was
// committed; see "Registry Tags" below.
let tags = RegistryTags::<Pasta>::from_beacon(&beacon_output);

// Build application with production parameters
let app = ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, 4>::new()
    .register(step1)?
    .register(step2)?
    .finalize(pasta, tags)?;
```

**Why these parameters?**
- `Pasta`: Standard curve cycle for PCD
- `R<13>`: 2,048 gates — enough for most steps
- `4`: Four field elements per header - balance between flexibility and
  performance

## Registry Tags

`finalize` takes the application's registry tags: one field element per
registry, injected into every circuit's wiring polynomial. They exist so that
whoever controls the circuit definitions cannot adapt them to Fiat-Shamir
challenges that have already been derived.

The registry tag ($\kappa$) must be sampled independently and without bias
after the complete pre-keyed system description has been fixed and publicly
committed, then permanently bound to that description. Here the description
is every registered step plus Ragu's internal circuits; changing any of them
produces a new description, which needs new tags.

`RegistryTags::from_beacon` derives both tags from the output of a public
randomness beacon, such as a block hash published after the code was
committed. `RegistryTags::insecure_test_values` provides fixed tags for tests;
a production build must never use it.

Nothing in Ragu can verify that a tag was drawn correctly. Publish the
procedure alongside the pinned value so that third parties can check it. The
`Tag` documentation in `ragu_circuits` states the requirement in full.

### Ceremony

The procedure below produces tags that satisfy the requirement and leaves a
record third parties can check. It uses a Bitcoin block hash as the beacon and
[OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org) as the public commitment, which
is what the "publicly committed" clause needs: proof that the code existed
before the beacon output did.

1. **Freeze the code.** Land every circuit change, including all application
   steps, and note the commit hash `X`. Any change to a registered circuit
   after this point restarts the ceremony.
2. **Commit to it publicly.** Timestamp `X`:
   `printf '%s\n' X > commit.txt && ots stamp commit.txt`, and keep
   `commit.txt.ots`. Once a calendar's transaction confirms,
   `ots upgrade commit.txt.ots` turns the pending proof into a Bitcoin
   attestation naming a block height `N` (take the earliest if several
   calendars attest). Pushing the commit is not a substitute: only the
   attestation proves the ordering to someone who does not trust the
   repository host.
3. **Draw the beacon output.** Wait for block `N + 100`, far past any
   reorganization, and record its hash `B` from more than one source.
4. **Derive the tags.** `cargo run -p ragu_pcd --example registry_tags -- B`
   prints the native and nested tags; in code this is
   `RegistryTags::<Pasta>::from_beacon(&B)`.
5. **Pin and publish.** Ship `B`, `X`, `N` and `commit.txt.ots` together with
   the application, and derive the tags from `B` in code rather than pasting
   the field elements, so the derivation stays reproducible.

To check a published ceremony: verify the attestation (`ots verify` against a
Bitcoin node, or `ots info` for the height), confirm block `N + 100`'s hash is
`B` on an independent explorer, and repeat step 4.

## Parameter Selection Guide

### Starting a New Project

1. **Testing**: `ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<7>, 1>`
   - Quick iterations
   - Minimal overhead
   - Test your logic

2. **Production**: `ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, 4>`
   - Standard capacity
   - Proven parameters
   - Well-tested

### Measuring Your Needs

Use `Simulator` to measure constraint usage:

```rust
use ragu_primitives::Simulator;

let sim = Simulator::simulate(witness, |dr, w| {
    my_step_logic(dr, w)?;
    Ok(())
})?;

println!("Gates: {}", sim.num_gates());
```

For `R<7>`, the gate limit is 32.
For `R<13>`, the gate limit is 2,048.
If your circuit exceeds these, add a larger rank (see the `Rank` trait
documentation).

## Advanced: Multiple Configurations

You can build different applications with different parameters:

```rust
// Small, fast application for testing
let test_app = ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, TestRank, 1>::new()
    .register(small_step)?
    .finalize(pasta, RegistryTags::insecure_test_values())?;

// Production application, with tags drawn for exactly this set of steps
let prod_app = ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, ProductionRank, 8>::new()
    .register(complex_step)?
    .finalize(pasta, prod_tags)?;
```

Proofs from different configurations are **not compatible** - they're
entirely separate proof systems.

### ✗ Header Size Mismatch

```rust
// Application configured for 4 elements
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<13>, 4>::new()

// But Header only provides 1!
impl Header<F> for MyHeader {
    type Output = Kind![F; Element<'_, _>];  // Only 1 element
}
```

**Error**: Type mismatch at compile time.

**Fix**: Match HEADER_SIZE to your header's actual size.

### ✗ Rank Too Small

```rust
ApplicationBuilder::<Pasta, R<7>, 4>::new()  // Only 32 gates

// Step uses 2 Poseidon hashes = ~280 constraints
// Plus proof verification overhead = ~1500 total
// Exceeds 32!
```

**Error**: `GateBoundExceeded(32)` at runtime.

**Fix**: Switch to `R<13>` or add a larger rank.

### ✗ Missing the `baked` Feature

```toml
[dependencies]
ragu_pasta = "0.1"  # Missing features = ["baked"]
```

**Error**: Compile error — `Pasta::baked()` does not exist without the feature.

**Fix**: Add `features = ["baked"]` to the `ragu_pasta` dependency, or use
`Pasta::generate()` instead.
